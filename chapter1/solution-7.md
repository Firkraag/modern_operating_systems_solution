# Problem
The family-of-computers idea was introduced in the 1960s with the IBM System/360 mainframes. Is this idea now dead as a doornail or does it live on?
# Solution
This idea does live on, since

- Developing and maintaining two completely different product lines was an expensive proposition for the manufacturers. 
- Since the machines all had the same architecture and instruction set, programs written for one machine could run on all the others, so  program is written once and run everywhere.
- Two computers of same family only differ in performance, so users can switch to another computer of the same family when they need better performance of some software.
