# Problem
One reason GUIs were initially slow to be adopted was the cost of the hardware needed to support them. How much video RAM is needed to support a 25-line × 80-row character monochrome text screen? How much for a 1200 × 900-pixel 24-bit color bit-map? What was the cost of this RAM at 1980 prices ($5/KB)? How much is it now?
# Solution
There are 25 * 80 = 2000 characters on a 25-line × 80-row character monochrome text screen. If one character occupies one byte, then the need video RAM is 2000byte = 1.95kb, the cost of this RAM at 1980 prices is 5 * 1.95 = 9.75.

For  for a 1200 × 900-pixel 24-bit color bit-map screen the needed video RAM is 1200 * 900 * 24 / 8 / 1024 = 3164 kb. At 1980, the cost is 3164 * 5 = 15820\$. At \$0.5/mb is costs roughly $1.54.
