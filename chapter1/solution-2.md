# Problem
In Section 1.4, nine different types of operating systems are described. Give a list of applications for each of these systems (one per operating systems type).
# Solution
1. Mainframe operating systems offer three kinds of services: batch, transaction processing, and timesharing.
2. Server operating systems serve multiple users at once over a network and allow the users to share hardware and software resources. Servers can provide print service, file service, or Web service.
3. Multiprocessor operating systems provide major-league computing power.
4. Personal computer operating systems provide good support to a single user. They are widely used for word processing, spreadsheets, games, and Internet access.
5. Handheld computer operating systems are used for tablets, smartphones and other handheld computers.
6. Embedded operating systems run on the computers that control devices that are not generally thought of as computers and which do not accept user-installed software. Typical examples are microwave ovens, TV sets, cars, DVD recorders, traditional phones, and MP3 players.
7. Sensor networks are used to protect the perimeters of buildings, guard national borders, detect fires in forests, measure temperature and precipitation for weather forecasting, glean information about enemy movements on battlefields, and much more.
8. In industrial process-control systems, real-time computers have to collect data about the production process and use it to control machines in the factory.
9. Smart card operating systems are used for electronic payments.
