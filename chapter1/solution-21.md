# Problem
What type of multiplexing (time, space, or both) can be used for sharing the following resources: CPU, memory, disk, network card, printer, keyboard, and display?
# Solution
Resource management includes multiplexing resources in two different ways: in time and in space. When a resource is time multiplexed, different programs or users take turns using it. When a resource is space multiplexed, different programs or users get part of the resource.

Time multiplexing:CPU, memory, disk, network card, printer, keyboard, and display.

Space multiplexing: memory, disk, display
