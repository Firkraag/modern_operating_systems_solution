# Problem
What is the difference between kernel and user mode? Explain how having two distinct modes aids in designing an operating system.
# Solution
Kernel mode has complete access to all the hardware and can execute any instruction the machine is capable of executing.

User mode can execute only a subset of instructions.

Kernel mode helps operating systems to manage access to hardware by user programs.
